#There are no real limit as to what you can use
#to implement the 3 procedures EXCEPT that they
#must take the specified inputs and return at the
#specified outputs as seen on the assignment PDF.
#If convention is not followed, you will be
#deducted marks.

main:
#build a linked list
#print "Original linked list\n"
#print the original linked list

#reverse the linked list
#On a new line, print "reversed linked list\n"
#print the reversed linked list
#terminate program

build:
#continually ask for user input UNTIL user inputs "*"
#FOR EACH user inputted character inG, create a new node that hold's inG AND an address for the next node
#at the end of build, return the address of the first node to $v1

print:
#$a0 takes the address of the first node
#prints the contents of each node in order

reverse:
#$a1 takes the address of the first node of a linked list
#reverses all the pointers in the linked list
#$v1 returns the address
